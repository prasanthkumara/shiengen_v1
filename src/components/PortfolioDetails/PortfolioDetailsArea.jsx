                    A recognizable and loved brand is one of the most valuable
                    assets a company owns. In fact, 59% of customers prefer to
                    buy products from brands they know. How do you become a
                    sought-after brand with endless sales and raving fans? By
                    identifying your promise to a customer or client.

                  This shortage is being seen in both the airline and the cargo
                  industries. With such a small pool of applicants to choose
                  from, these two sectors are
                  <span className="hg-light">battling</span> to get the most
                  qualified available candidates. Many pilots are increasingly
                  being wooed to get behind the controls of passenger planes
                  over cargo flights—frankly, it’s tough to compete with jobs
                  perks like fixed schedules & free flights for your family
                  across the world. This is no anecdotal pilot shortage,
                  either—the same problems are found on a global scale, with
                  Boeing estimating an incredible shortage of
                  <span className="hg-light">790,000</span> or more pilots
                  across the world over the next two decades. In the shorter
                  term, the domestic industry can expect more than
                  <span className="hg-light">8,000</span>.
